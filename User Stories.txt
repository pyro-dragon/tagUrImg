As a user I want
    the program to tell me if there are any new files when I open the program.
    to be able to brows all the new, tagless files
    to be able to add tags to multiple new files.
    to browse the tags I have added.
    the program to help suggest tags as I type them.
    the program to suggest related tags.
    to have related tags added.
    to have syntactically similar words relate to the same tag (eg, skirt - skirts).
    filter images based on tags.
    add new directories to include.
    export my data.
    scan for duplicate images.
    link tags to image files if the file path changes.

As a developer I want
    to arrange tags hierachically (eg, skirt -> clothes).
    filter out certain directories and file types from being scanned.
    to bundle all dependencies into one installer package for easy distribution.
